Scenario: Booking System Based on Calendar,  Appointment, and Booking

Core Components:
    Calendar:
        Each property will have its own calendar.
        The calendar serves as a record of available and booked dates for that property.
        This calendar helps prevent double-booking by checking whether the requested dates overlap with any existing bookings.

    Appointment:
        The Appointment would represent the intention to book a property for specific dates.
        It will be associated with:
            The property being booked.
            The user making the booking.
            Check-in/check-out dates.
            Status (pending, confirmed, canceled).

    Booking:
        Once an Appointment is successfully confirmed (i.e., after checking availability), it becomes a Booking.
        The Booking represents the finalized reservation for the property.
        This Booking will be associated with:
            The Appointment from which it was created.
            The Property.
            The user who made the booking.
            The Calendar, to update the reserved dates.

Process Flow:
    Property Search and Calendar Check:
        A user selects a property and chooses a date range for their stay.
        The system checks the property’s calendar for availability:
            Are there any existing bookings or appointments for these dates?
            If the dates are available, the user can proceed with the booking request.

    Appointment Creation:
        Once availability is confirmed, an Appointment is created.
        The Appointment holds all the details of the request:
            Property
            User
            Check-in and check-out dates
            Number of guests (if applicable)
            Special requests (if any)
            Status (e.g., pending until confirmed).

    Calendar Updates:
        The property’s Calendar is updated with a tentative hold for the requested dates (you may want to hold these dates temporarily).
        This prevents other users from booking the same property for the same dates while the booking is being processed.

    Booking Confirmation:
        Once the Appointment is confirmed (either automatically or by the host’s approval, depending on your rules), it becomes a Booking.
        The Booking will be associated with:
            The Appointment that initiated it.
            The Property.
            The Calendar, where the dates are permanently reserved.
        The booking’s status changes to confirmed.

    Cancelation/Modification:
        If a user cancels their Appointment before it becomes a Booking, the system simply releases the dates back to the Calendar.
        If the Booking is already confirmed, cancelation rules apply:
            If cancellation is allowed, the Calendar is updated to mark the dates as available again.
        If a user wants to modify a Booking (like changing dates), it can be handled through updating the Appointment or directly modifying the Booking (depending on your system’s rules).

Relationships:

    Property → Calendar:
        Every property has a Calendar that tracks its availability (booked or free dates).

    Appointment → Property:
        Each Appointment is associated with a specific property.
        It also holds the dates and other relevant details for that property’s booking.

    Booking → Appointment:
        Once an Appointment is confirmed, it transforms into a Booking.
        The Booking is the actual reservation that marks the dates on the calendar as confirmed.

    Booking → Calendar:
        The confirmed Booking updates the Calendar by reserving the specific dates for the property.
        This prevents any further bookings for those dates.




    Calendar-Centric Design: The calendar is central to managing availability and preventing double bookings. It acts as the master record of when a property is available or booked.

    Appointment Flexibility: The Appointment step allows you to manage booking requests easily. It gives you a clear structure to track whether a request is pending, confirmed, or canceled. It also gives flexibility to modify or update bookings before they’re finalized.

    Booking Finality: Once confirmed, the Booking becomes a fixed entity. You can lock the dates on the Calendar and ensure the reservation is set in stone. This also gives you control over cancellation and modification rules.
